                                    Under the Child's Online Privacy Security Act, no Website operator can require, as a condition to involvement in an activity, that a child younger than 13 years of age divulge more details than is reasonably required. Sairam Tek LLC abides by this demand. Sairam Tek LLC just collects information willingly offered; no information is gathered passively. children under 13 can submit only their email address when sending us an email in our "Contact Us" area. Sairam Tek LLC makes use of the email address to respond to a one-time demand from a child under 13 and afterwards deletes the email address. In case Sairam Tek LLC collects and maintains personal information relating to a child under 13, the parent may send out an email to us to review, alter and/or erase such info as well as to decline to enable any additional collection or use of the child's information.
